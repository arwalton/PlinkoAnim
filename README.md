# PlinkoAnim
Cheap ascii animation of a plinko game.

I made this in my first coding class. We only had to simulate the game and report the results, but I had some spare time on my hands and decided to see if I could animate it in the console with ascii characters. I got it to work, but the code is definitely a beginner's work.
